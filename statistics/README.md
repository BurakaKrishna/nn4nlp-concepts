the script draw_bar.py  can be used to draw a bar chart that illustrates the frequency of each concept on all the papers. For example, 

``python draw_bar.py --csv log.abs --fig abs.png``
where 
``log.abs`` is an input file, each line of which is as: concept \t frequency.
`abs.png`   is the output figure.
